# Foodie-Fi 

- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, 
- write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT * 
  FROM subscriptions s 
  JOIN plans p 
  ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE customer_id IN ('1', '2', '11', '13', '15', '16', '18', '19')
  ```
 ## Data Analysis Questions
  
 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
 
  ```sql
 SELECT COUNT(distinct customer_id) As Total_Customers
 FROM subscriptions s
 ```

 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset? Use the start of the month as the group by value 
  ```sql
 SELECT date_part('month', start_date) ,to_char(start_date, 'month') As month, 
 count(CASE WHEN plan_id = 0 THEN plan_id ELSE NULL END) AS count_of_trial
 FROM subscriptions
 GROUP BY 1, 2
 ORDER BY 1
 ```

3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name 
 ```sql
SELECT p.plan_id, p.plan_name, COUNT(CASE WHEN date_part('year', s.start_date) = 2020 THEN s.customer_id ELSE NULL END) AS Event_2020, 
COUNT(CASE WHEN date_part('year', s.start_date) = 2021 THEN s.customer_id ELSE NULL END) AS event_2021 	
FROM subscriptions s 
JOIN plans p 
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1
```

4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
 ```sql
WITH CTE AS 
(
SELECT COUNT(distinct s.customer_id) AS total_customer_count,
COUNT(distinct CASE WHEN p.plan_id = 4 THEN customer_id ELSE NULL END) AS churned_count
FROM subscriptions s 
LEFT JOIN plans p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
) 
SELECT *, ROUND(CAST(CTE.churned_count as numeric)/ CAST(CTE.total_customer_count as numeric) * 100,1) AS percentage
FROM CTE 
```

5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial? What percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

		FROM subscriptions s 
		LEFT JOIN plans p
		ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
		ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date
	) 
	SELECT COUNT(distinct CASE WHEN plan_name = 'trial' AND subsequent = 'churn' THEN customer_id END) AS total_count
	FROM CTE
) 
SELECT *, ROUND(cast((total_count) as numeric)/1000 * 100, 1) AS percentage
FROM CTE2
```

	COUNT(distinct CASE WHEN plan_name = 'trial' AND subsequent = 'churn' THEN customer_id END) AS total_churn
	FROM CTE
) 
SELECT *, ROUND(cast((total_basic) as numeric)/1000 * 100, 0) AS basic_pct, 
ROUND(cast((total_pro) as numeric)/1000 * 100, 0) AS pro_pct, 
ROUND(cast((total_annual) as numeric)/1000 * 100, 0) AS annual_pct,

-- Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

 ```sql
WITH customer_time AS

SELECT s.customer_id, MAX(start_date) - (SELECT MIN(start_date) FROM subscriptions WHERE customer_id = s.customer_id) AS days_diff
FROM subscriptions s
WHERE s.plan_id = 3
GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT MIN(days_diff), MAX(days_diff) 
FROM customer_time;
-- our range is between 7 and 346 days, hence the interval should be up till 360 days. 
-- The number of intervals required is then 12. 
SELECT s.customer_id, s.start_date - (SELECT MIN(start_date) FROM subscriptions 
									  WHERE customer_id = s.customer_id) AS c1
FROM subscriptions s
WHERE s.plan_id = 3 
GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.start_date

SELECT * FROM Subscriptions

WITH upgrade AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, s.plan_id, s.start_date,
(WIDTH_BUCKET((s.start_date-(SELECT MIN(start_date) 
							 FROM subscriptions 
							 WHERE customer_id = s.customer_id)),0,360,12) - 1) AS bucket
FROM subscriptions s
WHERE s.plan_id = 3
)
SELECT bucket, CASE WHEN bucket = 0 THEN bucket * 30 || '-' || (bucket+1) * 30 || ' days' 
ELSE (bucket * 30) + 1 || '-' || (bucket + 1) * 30 || ' days' END AS period, 
COUNT (distinct customer_id) As count 
FROM 
upgrade 
GROUP BY bucket, period
order by bucket
```

-- How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
 ```sql
